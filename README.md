# R_Analysis_of_Experiments

This unit introduces the principles of randomised experiments and practical quantitative tools for analysing the data from such experiments. The emphasis is on choosing and applying appropriate methods, rather than technical details and formal inference. Topics include controlled experiments versus observational studies; different experimental designs—confounding, misinterpretation; biases—blinding and randomisation; and analysis—linear regression, linear models and analysis of variance.
